# Automated Infrastructure Deployment for B2B Discounting Framework using Terraform

## Overview

This repository contains the code and configuration for automating the infrastructure deployment of Ciscoâ€™s B2B discounting framework using Terraform. The goal is to enhance scalability, reliability, and security while integrating continuous deployment practices.

## Objectives

- **Automate Infrastructure Deployment:** Utilize Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate AWS resource provisioning.
- **Enhance Scalability and Reliability:** Develop a highly available and scalable infrastructure to support the discounting framework.
- **Implement CI/CD Pipeline:** Set up a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to streamline updates and deployments.
- **Ensure Security and Compliance:** Apply best practices for infrastructure security and compliance.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Terraform:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool for provisioning and managing cloud resources.
- **Jenkins:** CI/CD tool for automating the build and deployment processes.
- **AWS:** Cloud services used for infrastructure components (VPC, EC2, Subnets, ELB, S3, DynamoDB).
- **GitHub:** Version control platform for code management and collaboration.

## Key Features

- **Automated Provisioning:** Scripts to automatically create and manage AWS resources.
- **Modular Design:** Terraform modules for reusable and maintainable infrastructure code.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Jenkins pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- **State Management:** Secure storage of Terraform state files using S3 and DynamoDB for state locking.

## Getting Started
