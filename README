## üéØ Objectives

1. **Automate Infrastructure Deployment:** Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate the provisioning of AWS resources.
2. **Enhance Scalability and Reliability:** Design a scalable and highly available infrastructure to support the discounting framework.
3. **Implement CI/CD Pipeline:** Integrate continuous integration and continuous deployment practices to ensure seamless updates and deployments.
4. **Ensure Security and Compliance:** Follow best practices for securing infrastructure and ensuring compliance with organizational policies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools Used

- **Programming Languages:** Terraform (HCL)
- **CI/CD Tools:** Jenkins
- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **Cloud Services:** AWS (VPC, EC2, Subnets, ELB, S3, DynamoDB)
- **DevOps Practices:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD)

## üîÑ Project Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Code Commit] -->|Trigger| B[Jenkins Build];
    B --> C[Terraform Init];
    C --> D[Terraform Plan];

    E --> F[AWS Infrastructure Provisioned];
    F --> G[Monitoring & Logging];
    G -->|Alerts| H[DevOps Team];
    G -->|Logs| I[Compliance Check];
```

1. **Code Management:** Infrastructure code is managed in a GitHub repository.
2. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Jenkins monitors the repository and triggers builds for any changes.
3. **Terraform Execution:** Jenkins executes Terraform scripts to provision and manage AWS resources.
4. **State Management:** Terraform state files are stored in S3 and locked using DynamoDB to prevent concurrent modifications.
5. **Resource Provisioning:** AWS resources (VPC, EC2, subnets, ELB) are created and configured as per the Terraform scripts.

## üåü Impact and Achievements

- **Enhanced Efficiency:** Reduced deployment times from days to minutes through automation.
- **Scalability:** Enabled seamless scaling of the discounting application to handle increasing load and demand.
- **Reliability:** Achieved high availability and fault tolerance with ELB and properly configured subnets.
- **Security:** Ensured secure infrastructure provisioning with strict IAM policies and automated state management.
- **Consistency:** Maintained consistent and reproducible infrastructure deployments with Terraform's state management and version control.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

- Install Terraform: [Terraform Installation Guide](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
- Install Jenkins: [Jenkins Installation Guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/)
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. Initialize Terraform:
    ```sh
    terraform init
    ```

3. Plan and apply the infrastructure:
    ```sh
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

---

## üìö Usage

1. Update the Terraform scripts as needed for your infrastructure.
2. Push changes to the GitHub repository to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
3. Monitor the Jenkins pipeline and AWS infrastructure for successful deployment.
