## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Automate Infrastructure Deployment:** Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to automate the provisioning of AWS resources.
2. **Enhance Scalability and Reliability:** Design a scalable and highly available infrastructure to support the discounting framework.
3. **Implement CI/CD Pipeline:** Integrate continuous integration and continuous deployment practices to ensure seamless updates and deployments.
4. **Ensure Security and Compliance:** Follow best practices for securing infrastructure and ensuring compliance with organizational policies.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools Used

- **Programming Languages:** Terraform (HCL)
- **CI/CD Tools:** Jenkins
- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **Cloud Services:** AWS (VPC, EC2, Subnets, ELB, S3, DynamoDB)
- **DevOps Practices:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD)
